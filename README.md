A fast, lightweight CLI tool to scan directories for credentialâ€‘stealer log archives (ZIP, RAR, 7z, tar/gz) produced by common infostealer malware such as RedLine, Raccoon, Vidar, and others.  
Stealerâ€‘Log Detector works recursively, identifies high-value artifacts (like `Passwords.txt`, browser `Cookies/`, crypto wallets, etc.), and outputs JSON reports suitable for SIEM ingestion.  
No external services, no telemetry â€“ just efficient, signature-based detection for infosec professionals, threat analysts, and incident responders.
