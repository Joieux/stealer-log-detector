## Overview

Stealerâ€‘Log Detector is a lightweight, high-speed command-line tool that recursively scans directories for log archives (ZIP, RAR, 7z, tar/gz) commonly produced by infostealer malware such as RedLine, Raccoon, Vidar, and others.

It identifies high-value artifacts (e.g., `Passwords.txt`, browser `Cookies/`, crypto wallets), and outputs results in a JSON format suitable for SIEM ingestion. No external services, no telemetryâ€”just efficient, signature-based detection for infosec professionals and responders.

---

## Features

- Signatureâ€‘based detection of highâ€‘value artifacts: `Passwords.txt`, `Cookies/`, crypto `wallets/`, and more
- Supports **ZIP**, **RAR**, **7z**, and **tar.gz** formats without extracting to disk
- Severity scoring: **CONFIRMED** (â‰¥2 high-confidence hits) vs **LIKELY**
- Fast, fully local scanningâ€”no network requests
- JSON reporting for SIEM and automation pipelines
- MITâ€‘licensed, open source, and easy to extend

## Getting Started

### Installation

#### 1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Joieux/stealer-log-detector.git
cd stealer-log-detector
```

#### 2. (Optional but recommended) Set up a Python virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

#### 3. Install dependencies:
```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Supported platforms: Linux, Windows, macOS

### Usage

To scan a directory:
```bash
python stealer_log_detector.py --scan /path/to/directory
```

#### Common Options

- `--scan <path>`: Path to the directory to scan (required)
- `--output <file>`: Write JSON report to the specified file
- `--verbose`: Enable verbose output
- `--help`: Show all command-line options

For more options and help, run:
```bash
python stealer_log_detector.py --help
```

### Output Example

```json
{
    "status": "success",
    "summary": {
        "confirmed": 2,
        "likely": 3
    },
    "artifacts": [
        {"type": "passwords.txt", "path": "example/passwords.txt"},
        {"type": "wallet", "path": "example/crypto_wallet.dat"}
    ]
}
```
- **status**: success or error
- **summary.confirmed**: Number of CONFIRMED hits (â‰¥2 high-confidence artifacts)
- **summary.likely**: Number of LIKELY hits (1 high-confidence artifact)
- **artifacts**: List of detected artifact types and their paths

## FAQ

**Q: What log file formats are supported?**  
A: ZIP, RAR, 7z, and tar.gz archives.

**Q: Can I extend detection signatures?**  
A: Yes! Edit/add artifact signatures in the codebase to support new indicators.

**Q: Does it extract files to disk?**  
A: No, archives are scanned in-memory for speed and safety.

**Q: Is this safe for production or automation?**  
A: Yes; it runs fully locally, produces machine-readable output, and does not transmit data externally.

**Q: What are the limitations?**  
A: Currently, only common stealer log formats and artifacts are supported. Detection is signature-based and may not catch all variants.
